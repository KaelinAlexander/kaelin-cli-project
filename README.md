# Kaelin::Cli::Project

Welcome to the "Parks Near You" CLI Project. With this app, you can search for National Park Service sites -- including National Parks, Historic Sites, Monuments, and other destinations -- by accessing the National Park Service (NPS) API. After searching by state, you'll have the option to see more details about any NPS sites, and can run searches for other states afterwards.

## Installation

To begin the app:

  1. Clone the repo.
  2. Type 'cd kaelin-cli-project'
  3. Type 'bundle install'
  4. Upon completion of the installation, start the CLI by running:

    $ ruby bin/parks-near-you

  5. Then, follow the prompts.

## Usage

  1. Follow the prompts from the CLI.
  2. Please note that states and territories must be entered using their two-letter postal abbreviations.
  3. Simply use 'y' or 'n' to answer 'yes' or 'no' questions.
